# Muslamic Makers - Introduction to Data Science

This is the Github Repository that accompanies the Muslamic Makers Introduction to Data Science course. In this repository, you will find the notebooks, presentations and resources used in the course. It is also where any assignments will be posted. It is recommended for you to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository in your own personal user space to make any changes without affecting the original repository. 

# What is this Course?

This course is a brief introduction to the field of data science and data engineering. If you've seen the emergence of the field of Machine Learning and Aritifical Intelligence and are confused by the number of bootcamps or potention starting points, then this can serve as a useful introduction.

We will begin by introducing the field of data science and list the potential roles possible in the industry today. From this, you'll learn if this field really is for you and where you might fit in with respect to your interests.

Then we will introduce you to basic programming skills which will be fundamental as you progress in your learning journey no matter which learning pathway you pursue. 

Finally, there is introduction to statistical thinking and machine learning section where we introduce basic ideas around mathematical modelling and why it can be so useful.

**NOTE**: 

This course is **NOT** a bootcamp. Most of what you need to learn to be an effective data scientist or data engineer is available for free online. This is a preliminary course to equip you with skills so you can venture out and make sense of the free resources on your own.

If you do subsequently decide to pursue a more structured bootcamp, this course will give you the necessary preliminaries to assess its value proposition. We want to help you think critically about your next steps vs get swept up in the predatory `Machine Learning is the future, learn about it for $5000 here` type marketing. 

# Why Should you take this Course? 

Being a beginner in a new field is difficult. There are so many places to start who are offering you courses, bootcamps and books, which can become very confusing and overwhelming. 

We've found that everyone wants you to give you their money first and then trust them to see you through. We believe this approach is misguided, we want to give you an accurate glimpse of an increasingly exciting field so you can decide if it's for you and how to get started. 

There's no hype, no glossy marketing and no sugarcoating around what you need to know or what is expected of you. All we promise is a helpful support structure. 

If you want a guided introduction to this field by people who do it everyday then this is a good way to see if this field is for you.

Here are a list of reasons why you may consider taking this course:

1. It's free!

2. We're not a bootcamp: We want to act as a bridge for you into this field and educate you about what is really out there. Then you can make a more informed choice about all the millions of Coursera and Udemy courses that are being put your way. If you know what is important to learn, your research can be more efficient.

3. It's by Muslims: If you're part of the Muslim community sometimes it can be more difficult to get started in a field that doesn't represent your demographic. Some people feel more comfortable (at least initially) with people who have the same values as them, if that's you then we'll be aware of your concerns and sensitivites.

4. You're getting access to a community: You don't just get access to the course instructors but also an opportunity to join the Machine Learning community in the Muslamic Makers Slack channel. This channels is full of people who have gone through the initial entry process and can support you in a variety of ways.

5. You'll learn something new and useful even if you decide to never go near Data Science or Machine Learning again: The skills we're teaching are fundamental that will be used whether you work exclusively in Excel or work as an accountant.

# Who is this Course for?

This course is for you if you've heard about AI, ML and data science but donâ€™t know how to start in the field. 

We want to equip participants with basic ideas and skills so that they can move through further workshops with ease. This means that by the end you should know:

- Basic programming in Python and Bash
- Key statistical ideas and libraries
- What kind of roles exist in data so you can filter your studies and go after what's best for you

This course is **NOT** for you if you have some proficiency in programming with Python or have an academic background in mathematics/ statistics or computer science.

If you have an academic background outside of the subjects already mentioned and have done statistical modelling with languages like R or Matlab, the coding parts of this course may be useful to you as a quick introduction to Python.

We're targeting potential career switchers, complete beginners or those who perform their data analystics in no-code tools like Excel or Power BI and want to enhance their capabilities.

# Getting Help

Learning is most effective when it's a communal activity. As an alternative to contacting the course instructors (which you should do), please join the [Muslamic Makers Slack](https://muslamicmakers.com/join-our-slack/) community and join the `ml-learning` channel. In this channel you will have a space to ask your questions and speak to people who have been through the journey you've been through. We're all a friendly bunch!
